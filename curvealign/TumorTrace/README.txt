The TumorTrace program is an automated image analysis tool, developed in MATLAB
(The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA), for examining the ECM surrounding cells or
tumors in the context of cellular morphology, protein expression and movement.
It takes as input multiple image channels, either single images or stacks
representing time-series or 3D data. It then finds a metric for the cell/cell
cluster morphology and outputs plots representing intensity, morphology,
collagen fiber alignment, and cell movement; .csv files containing raw data and
image files containing the regions of interest.
